                    <li>Connected to various APIs (Notion databases, Gitlab, V7 (training data platform)) with python to extract relevant data, and orchestrated using GCP functions and scheduler to load into Bigquery. This data was then then transformed using dbt for KPI reporting in LookerStudio.</li>
                    <li>Web-scraped data from multiple sources using python, GCP functions and scheduler to track UK and European recycled materials prices and indices in a dashboard. This enabled the business development team to advise clients on expected revenues for their product being traded.</li>
                    <li>Set up dbt Cloud model to calculate and output CV ML model accuracy report by client, material type and model version. Inputs were actual and predicted items and weights detected. Lead discussions about the output which enabled decision making on model go live and prioritising improvements.</li>                    
                    <li>Ran python ML models to annotate new training images and added to V7  for labelling. This required keeping up to date with the ML teams' code base, pulling from their repo and running locally.  
                    <li>Used NumPy to analyse images for quality to detect labelling and/or camera faults.
